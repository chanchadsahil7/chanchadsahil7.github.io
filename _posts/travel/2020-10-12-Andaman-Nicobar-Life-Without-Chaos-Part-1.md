## The need


Today I am going to take you all to a journey with me where we will try discover what life is and what really matters. Also, I'll walk you through my journey on how I overcame my fear of water.

This is the story of 2 friends Jons and Sahil (Myself), both of them are into the corporate world working as Software Developers in their mid 20's in Vizag - City of Destiny.
We were figuring... And realized it's important to seek discomfort. We were randomly having human psychology related talks (Won't go into deep because it was really some random stuff).

I distinctly remember Jons siting and wondering something while looking at the view outside the glass panels of the office (we had a nice beach view office in Vizag). It was 26 Febuary 2019 and we were in office working on a feature as usual. I felt the urge of travelling somewhere. So I asked Jons on what are his thoughts on travelling to the Andaman's. While we were discussing, I randomly opened ixigo.com and started checking flights from Vizag -> Port Blair.

## The Randomness
You might have heard the saying *“Kehte hain agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho … to poori kainath use tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai”* and guess what we both really wanted to go and the flight tickets were available at Rs. 2500 (One way). Can you imagine that? Average ticket to Andmans from anywhere in India is 6k to 10k One way. And that's when I realized that we should definitely go to the Andamans.

And that is where it all started we boarded the flight on 28 Feb 2020.

I was lucky to have the window seat. The view from the airplane was amazing and It was combination of blue and green colored water. It was so clear that even from airplane you could see the shore sand and black sea stones that were settled inside the water.

The excitement inside me was at the top since it was my first trip to a place that is not sharing the borders with rest of the India. We landed around 11am 28 Feb 2020 and right after the landing. We rushed towards the Phoenix Bay Jetty where you board the government ferry to other Islands in the Andamans. We were supposed to book government ferry tickets 6 days in advance. In order to get the tickets to be able travel to 2 Islands that we had planned we were 5 days late. Funny right? But we just went to the ticket counter and got ourself tickets to the ferry without any hassle (Maybe some external energy was with us in this trip).

Our ferry was at around 2:00 pm. Tt was only around 12 pm so went on a walk to near by places exploring to eat some sea food and trying to just not sit at one place and wait till the ferry leaves for the Havelock Island (Yes, Our first Island that we were hoping to).

## The Experience

We were all set to embark this journey towards the remote locations in the Andamans as our Ferry arrived at the bay. It was old school ship maintained by Indian Navy and it felt strong and bossy unlike those fancy curved private ferrys. Here are some pictures of the ferry and the entrance and some inside. It was ~5 hours journey to Havelock Island and I was pumped because it was my first time travelling through a ferry.

I used to only Imagine being on a ship and standing at the tip of the ship and feel the air whistling into my ears. And I was able to feel the joy of us taking this decision and becoming the part of this journey. It only takes a *Yes* to make memories and that is what I like about people who believe is *Yes Theory*.

Attaching the video and photos of majestic view while we were travelling to the Havelock Island. I literally felt that we were in some kind of a glitch because 360 Degrees there was no land, just water. The kind of shape that water waves were shaping into were so constant and it made me feel that I am in some kind of a glitch in the matrix.

I am literally out of words when I am writing this and I feel.

> The whole point of taking photographs and videos is so that you don’t have to explain memories with words. At last photographs and videos are all you are left with.

It was around 7 pm we reached to the Havelock Island. It was almost sunset time and without having the rush of where we will spend the night and how will be our stay etc. We just sat at the shore and enjoyed the peace. The infinity looking beach sunset. I allowed myself to dwell in this beautifull feeling of calmness away from the chaos. Basically was allowing my self to sink in the moment.
