Welcome to part 2 of the blog series:  Andaman & Nicobar - Life Without Chaos.

# Havelock Island

> “There's a sunrise and a sunset every single day, and they're absolutely free. Don't miss so many of them.”

## Dusk till Dawn

And with this motivation, we moved towards the village. In search of the accommodation, we were knocking every door that came in between.
Finally, we found a place to crash for the night. It was time to sleep and take some rest. I woke up at night, was not able to sleep so went to the beach. We were lucky to stay at a place where the beach was just 2 mins walk. I found something called *[bioluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence)* while walking on the shore. It was barely visible so not adding photo.

Cold winds and waves gave me an eternal bliss!. As I rested myself on the hammock I saw the dawn approaching the night sky.

We are all set for the day! let me show you where we stayed. The name of the place is called Dive India. It is run by some locals in the Island and it is super affordable at just Rs. 600 per night. I think you guys should check it out when you visit Havelock. I have a short video of the place.

This is the place where I learnt scuba diving and this was my first scuba diving experience.
We had our breakfast at Moon Cafe where we were staying. Food in Andaman is very tasty and there is no doubt in that.

After a shower and having tasty lunch we were finally ready to start our journey and explore the Island. We went to the nearby local shop and rented our selves a bicycle to roam around the island. The first place we went to was Radha Nagar beach were we helped a couple take pictures by the beach. They were considering us as locals cause we were dressed like one.

We were having a good time and decided to go to a small trek which leads us to Elephant Beach. This place is ideal for relaxing spending leisure time with food and drinks. Besides, if you feel like doing some fun activities this beach offers water sports like diving, snorkelling, swimming, bird-watching, trekking and kayaking. Being famous for its coral reefs, sea walking is also actively partaken and the best part is, anybody with a zest for adventure can indulge in this underwater fun.

It was a very peaceful evening that we spent. It was so silent that you can hear each trees quirking sound, birds chirping and waves. We went inside the water and enjoyed the real beach feeling. It was just amazing!

At around 7 pm we headed back because it was getting dark. Arrived at our stay and sat with locals and enjoyed the rest of the night.
