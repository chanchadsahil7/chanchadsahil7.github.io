Welcome to part 3 of the blog series: Andaman & Nicobar - Life Without Chaos.

This is a photoblog - taking you through the photos cause I don't remember what happened those few days.

A question to you. What is the full form of SCUBA? find an answer at last.

## Neil Island

> "NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST." - J.R.R Tolkien

This is the last part of my Andaman trip. We had a great time at Havelock Island and now it was time to hop to another Island. An Island so small and far away from the main islands this journey was getting more and more exciting for us.

### The Basic
We took our ferry from Havelock Islands to Neil island which was around 230 pm and the journey duration was almost 2 hours. We had our basic scuba diving experience in Havelock Island. Now it was time to go in the middle of the ocean and experience the fear of jumping into the wild and open Andaman Sea. Here is some cool picture of me scuba diving at Havelock Island near the seashore dept was almost 6 to 7 feet.

## Stay
We reached Neil Island and now it was time to search for a place to crash for a few nights. There are not many but a few good hotels and some homestays also. We stayed at a place called Kalapani Stays. We rented a shack for Rs. 300 per night. It was near to the beach and was an awesome place to hang out with people from different places. We made friends and had dinner nights. It was Amazing!

I don't have words to describe how fun it was and how much I miss that life. What I think is the point to travel and discover things is to find yourself and to find what you want to do.
I think there is a great power that is with you when you are free from this every day going world.
I don't know maybe I am right or maybe I am wrong. But this I have felt and that is why I shared.

## People and Stories.
I am sharing a few photos that I took while I was lost in the moment. I usually remember things with their timelines as soon as I see photos. This time I don't remember the conversations, the context, I don't know what it was but I was gone for those few days when I was in Neil Island.

I hope my photos will be able to help you go through the experience that I felt.

There was a girl from Russia who was staying in Andamans from almost 6 months and she was showing me her drawings. I am attaching a few photos of her drawings. She explained to me what is the things that are in the drawings. Every day she used to go for snorkelling in the morning and come back and draw what she saw.

I felt like I never felt before. I always love to listen to people and their stories. I found so many stories in the Andamans. Sometimes Listen.

> People start to heal. The moment the feel heard.

## The Dive
It was a perfect sunny day. It was the day I was going concur my biggest fear of water. It was time to dive into the mighty Andaman sea. I lost all my videos somehow and I am only left with some photos from my dive. But that doesn't make me sad because it is all there in my mind and that is enough for me.

This day was the best day of my life. I learned how to swim and I am no more afraid of water.

The thought and the life that I saw in the water was so calm and slow which made want to be a part of it. It was very pure and peaceful inside the water and I envy that life.

This brings us to an end to my most amazing trip! I am always up to travel the Andamans and I would like to also take you through this journey. Reach out to me if you want a partner to travel with.
