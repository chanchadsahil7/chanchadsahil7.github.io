Hey, Greetings for the day y'all today is 13 Oct 2020 Tuesday. 

## The Past

[Journal Entry - 001](https://chanchadsahil7.github.io/journal/Entry-001-Daily-Journal.html)

Yesterday I slept around 1:30 am. I achieved 2 things yesterday *Recorded My first vlog and blog* and *Edited and Upload the vlog and blog*. I am quite happy about the achievement. I would also like to thank my 2 friends [ Sasank](https://chsasank.github.io/) and [Bhargava](https://www.youtube.com/user/bhargavaiitb) (go check'em out they are super awesome people). They are the ones behind the motivation to write and vlog. I am super excited about this new hobby.

Today I woke up at 6 am. Usually, I don't get up this early my get up time is around 8 am to 9 am. There was a call with a client for a validation study that we were conducting with them. It went well with no issues with the client so the day is going to be okay! I guess.

Around 8 am I took clothes from the washing machine and went to the terrace to dry them. Was a very pleasant morning I would say. Then we came down and had breakfast with *mom's special tea*  and then started working on some Code Reviews and Dev stuff. 

Time is: 12:30 pm and I have not moved an inch from my chair. These days I can concentrate more on my work. I can get the most out of the time. I have started jotting down work-related stuff. It helps me prioritize them pretty well.

It is around 1:30 pm I smelled something from the kitchen. It was my favorite chai time snack *Puri*. I am attaching the photo so that it will be better to understand. It is not the soft fluffy puri that you eat with chole. It is very crunchy and thin like papad but it has great taste and I like it with chai.
I had my lunch and started working again.

I took a break at 4 pm. I went outside to switch my mother's Idea sim to Jio. We were having a lot of problems with the Idea. But that didn't happen because the store was closed today *Weird*. So while coming back to me and my brother we both did some groceries shopping and came back home.

I took a shower cause *It's corona time* and then I started editing my vlog around 6 pm. I got done with editing and rendering around 8:20 pm.
I am currently writing this blog in my daily journal.

At the end of the day, I feel very happy!
