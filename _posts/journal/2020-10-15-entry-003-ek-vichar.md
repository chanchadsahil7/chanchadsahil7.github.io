Hey, Greetings for the day y'all today is 15 Oct 2020 Thursday.

## The Normal Life 

Woke up today at around 9 am with motivation and energy to start my day.
Got fresh and made tea for my self which I don't usually do *tea was okay!*.
After so much positive response from my previous vlogs. I was more pumped to make more and more vlogs and record my life.

After having tea I started my work because of #workIsGod. I enjoy my morning tea with my mails from the night and slack messages. I would like to share something here because it might be helpful for a few people.

## How I organise my work

- **Eat that Elephant**: Complete the most important task. Will help you to relieve the stress.
- **Put limit to your work**: Decide a timeline for your work.
- **Take breaks**: Studies have shown that after 45 min you brain productivity starts declining. So take 5 - 10 min break. Stretch your body and allow your brain to regenerate.
- **Don’t be addicted to your mailbox**: Don't keep on checking emails and messages. Keep a timer or intervals lets say 45 mins so checking the messages.
- **Write it down**: Writing down work helps *trust me* it helps.
- **Choose five priorities each day (and no more)**: The best way to avoid it is to choose only five priorities each day and stick to them strictly.
- **Imagine your result**: Before you start your workday, don’t just rush into your work.
- **Think good thoughts before you go to sleep**

## EK Vichar 

I wanted to share one thought. So here it is! When I travel solo or with friends I make sure I am doing the minimalist stuff. That every traveller wants to do rather than being a tourist at a place. So the general feeling is whenever I visit such places I like to indulge in deep conversation with the locals. This helps me understand their culture and their religion. Which I think is the greatest experience to be in. In India, you have so much diverse culture. If you are travelling to such high altitude places where sustaining life is hard. So if you are there for a few days learning local things and helping them in their work will give you a great experience.

I think it is my job as a traveller/ trekker to bring this kind of content to people. As we all know not all can travel to such places. One has to be very enthusiastic and has to be trained for high altitude climbings or should have reached to be able to go to such places. I hope you get the point. If not go check out the vlog you will understand.

## The Evening

The evening was good. I taught my grandmother how to speak one sentence in English just for fun. She is enthusiastic enough to even give it a try.
