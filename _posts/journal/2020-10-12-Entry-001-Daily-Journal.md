## Intro to my life

Hello!

My name is Sahil Chanchad.

I live in Mumbai, although I am from Surat, Gujarat.
I did my UG in St. Xaviers College, Ahmedabad and PG from GITAM, Vizag. 
I majored in M.Sc Data Science and minored in BCA.
I am mainly interested in solving problems with tech.

I am a PADI certified Scuba Diver and a Certified Mountaineer.
I have been to Dainkund peak, Pin Parvati pass, Sar pass trek, Kheer Ganga etc.
I travel with the low budget.
I prefer TV series over Movies.

This is the very first beginning of my daily blogs and vlogs. I am very excited to share this with you all that I will be inculcating this as my hobby. I will be sharing a lot of general raw life related content on [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAybXEWlAk3q3hTfp-E-Y0w) and [Sahil's Blog](https://chanchadsahil7.github.io/).

### General Thought

I have been thinking about creating content for myself and journaling it daily since a long time. It gives me pleasure. I like creating fun videos with friends and family. I like to sing with people. Although I dont know professtional dancing but surely have energy more than professional dancers. I do candid photography a lot of the times (you checkout my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chanchad_/?hl=en)) and there are many more things that I like to do. But there is one common thing in all of this is to either take pictures or take videos.

So I thought of it and with this aim in life about creating content in whichever format possible I am going to do it.

I believe in below philosophy :

> The whole point of taking photographs and videos is so that you don’t have to explain memories with words. Atlast photographs and videos are all you are left with.

## Journal Entry - 001

## First half of the day.
I am Writing this today from my hometown Surat. I am staying with my family from past few months Covid-19 situation.
I started my day at 9:00 am today. Was feeling a bit lazy to get up due to cold weather in Surat.

I usually like to start off my day with drinking hot water with 2 lemons mixed. And then I have a cup of tea to give boost to my mind and body and then I get going for the day. I enjoyed today's tea.
My Mom prepares tea for me with something special. I find it hard to make the same tea with the same taste even though she is standing beside me and helping me (Maybe she is hiding something :p).

Now I feel fresh and energetic so I started working around 10 am. I check all my personal and work related mails. That helps me to design and prioritize my work through out the day. I had a very crucial meeting with Astra Zeneca which I was tensed about. The meeting went well and we had clear understanding on clients requirements from a technical stand point. All meetings and Internal discussion got done for the day at least the one I am aware of.

### Some random stuff 
My brother was planning to go to RTO office with his friends. I asked him to make vlogs on his way with his friends just for fun (which he didn't make). It's time for the lunch my mother prepared Rotli (Phulka with butter) yeah we call it rotli in Gujarati and boiled chana masala (I don't know what it is called in English). It was very delicious. I like cereals/ beans of all kind I love them!. I can eat them everyday day and won't require green vegetables. Got done with lunch and it is almost 12:30 pm.

### Work From Home suggestion.
let's get back to work. While working I was listening to some [Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QY2_8704o&t=6232s) which I listen while coding. This music in background help me to avoid disturbance from the background and help me in concentrating on stuff. You guys should give it a try.

## Second half of the day.
### Again Some random stuff 
Washed my dishes after Washed my dishes after having lunch cause Modiji told *Atma Nirbhar Bharat*. Then at around 2pm water is purified at my place for storing drinking water because SMC says *Mah City.. Mah Rules* hehe. zyada ho gaya I know. I like helping my mother with small work. I help her collect clothes from terrace and sometimes help her in mopping also.

Went back to work and realized that my data pack is exhausted and also from morning wifi wasn't working. So i have now no other solution but to wait for the internet to come back. So I spent time on writing my first ever [Andaman Travel Blog](https://chanchadsahil7.github.io/travel/Andaman-Nicobar-Life-Without-Chaos-Part-1.html).
Give it a read if you are interested.

And just to add to the pain of no internet, electricity at my place also had to go. Anyway *nothing can stop me I am all the way up*. Sat by my balcony watching kids play and one aunty cleaning the society took a timelapse of that.

And in the end it doesn't even matter. Life is all about experiences during the journey.

> See you tomorrow!!
